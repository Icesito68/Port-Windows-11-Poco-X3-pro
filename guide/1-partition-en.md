This step is required so that we make partitions where our Windows installation will be

## Notes:
- These commands have been tested.
- Ignore `udevadm` warnings
- Do not run the same command twice
- DO NOT REBOOT YOUR PHONE if you think you made a mistake, ask for help in the [Telegram chat](https://t.me/winonvayu)

#### Boot TWRP recovery through the PC with the command
```cmd
fastboot boot <twrp.img>
```
> if you already have TWRP installed, just hold the power and vol+ buttons at startup

#### Unmount all partitions
Go to TWRP settings and unmount all partitions

## Push needed tools:
```cmd
adb push parted sfdisk /sbin
```

## Start the ADB shell
```cmd
adb shell
```

# Setup Partitions
#### Give correct permissions to the tools
```sh
chmod +x /sbin/*
```

### Backup the partiton table
```sh
sfdisk -d /dev/block/sda > /sdcard/sda.part
```
> put the file somewhere safe

### Resize the partition table
> so that the Windows partitions would fit
```sh
sgdisk --resize-table 64 /dev/block/sda
```

### Start parted
```sh
parted /dev/block/sda
```


### Delete the `userdata` partition
> you can make sure that 32 is the userdata partition number by running
>  `print all`
```sh
rm 32
```

### Create partitions
> If you get any warning message telling you to ignore or cancel, just type i and enter

#### For 128Gb models:

- Create the ESP partition (stores Windows bootloader data and EFI files)
```sh
mkpart esp fat32 11.8GB 12.2GB
```

- Create the main partition where Windows will be installed to
```sh
mkpart win ntfs 12.2GB 70.2GB
```

- Create Android's data partition
```sh
mkpart userdata f2fs 70.2GB 127GB
```


#### For 256Gb models:

- Create the ESP partition (stores Windows bootloader data and EFI files)
```sh
mkpart esp fat32 11.8GB 12.2GB
```

- Create the main partition where Windows will be installed to
```sh
mkpart win ntfs 12.2GB 132.2GB
```

- Create Android's data partition
```sh
mkpart userdata f2fs 132.2GB 255GB
```


### Make ESP partiton bootable so the EFI image can detect it
```sh
set 32 esp on
```

### Quit parted
```sh
quit
```

### Reboot to TWRP

### Start the shell again on your PC
```cmd
adb shell
```

### Format partitions
-  Format the ESP partiton as FAT32
```sh
mkfs.fat -F32 -s1 /dev/block/by-name/esp
```

-  Format the Windows partition as NTFS
```sh
mkfs.ntfs -f /dev/block/by-name/win
```

- Format data
Go to Wipe menu and press Format Data, 
then type `yes`.

### Check if Android still starts
just restart the phone, and see if Android still works
